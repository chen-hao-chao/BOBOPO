# BOBOPO
This is a simple music maker. The original idea of creating BOBOPO is a DJ turntable.
I have been in love with electric music since I saw the movie, Pitch Perfect, and I think it would be interesting to write a music-making program.The explanation is divided into two parts. One is about program, the other is about my impression.

## About
I programmed BOBOPO using C++ with Allegro. Compared with C language, it is more effecient and easier.
Because of using some functions repeatedly, OOP is more advantageous to deal with gigantic programming structure.
I think BOBOPO has clear structure, and I patiently programmed every classes and created different functions.
However, I have to say that, in BOBOPO, most of the objects are individually coded into a class and contains lots of functions,
but some of the trivial funtions awfully placed in the main body, such as the choose buttoms function.

Logically speaking, animation is a throny problem, but I am also the animation maker.
Fortunately, I can control the output format of those images. As a resualt, I can simplify the coding and reduce some calculations.
Another feature is using pointer. I used pointers to add and delete objects appeared in BOBOPO. The reason is nothing but effeciency.
Because the "Panel" object is so ineffecient that if I raise the resolution, the program is going to crash,
I should clean it if I am not using it, and pointer is the key.

Note: I am not sure that the music in the release is permitted.
