# BOBOPO
This is a simple music maker. The original idea of creating BOBOPO is a DJ turntable.
I have been in love with electric music since I saw the movie, Pitch Perfect, and I think it would be interesting to write a music-making program.

The explanation is divided into two parts. The one is about this program, the other is about my impression.
