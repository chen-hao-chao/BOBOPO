# BOBOPO
This is a simple music maker. The original idea of creating BOBOPO is a DJ turntable.
I have been in love with electric music since I saw the movie, Pitch Perfect, and I think it would be interesting to write a music-making program. The explanation is divided into two parts. One is about program, the other is about my impression.

## Introduction
I wrote BOBOPO using C++ with Allegro. Compared with C language, it is more effecient and easier.
By using some functions repeatedly, OOP is more favorable when it comes to dealing with gigantic programming structure.
I think BOBOPO has clear structure, and I patiently programmed every classes and created different functions.

Generally, animation is a throny problem for a game programmer, but it does not badger me since I am also the animation maker.
Fortunately, I can control the output format of all of those sprite sheets. As a resualt, I can simplify the code and reduce some calculations.
Another feature of this gane is using pointers to add and delete objects appeared in BOBOPO. Things toward as we use pointers. For example, the "Panel" object is so computational expensive that the program is going to crash if not handled properly, and programming with pointers makes the deleting process simple and fast.

Note: I am not sure that the music in the release is permitted.
